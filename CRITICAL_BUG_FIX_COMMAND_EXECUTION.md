# Critical Bug Fix: Command Execution in Wrong Directory

## Issue Description

**Problem**: Agent responds that it created files/apps inside a project, but when checking the project directory, nothing actually changed.

**Root Cause**: When the MCP server is unavailable (which happens in tests and potentially in production), the `executeCommand` method falls back to local execution but uses the wrong working directory.

## Bug Details

### Location
`backend/src/mcp/mcp.service.ts` - `executeCommand()` method

### The Bug
1. **Line 700**: Fallback execution used `this.workspaceRoot` instead of the provided `workingDir` parameter
2. **Line 699**: Used `command` instead of `actualCommand` (which has cd parsing applied)
3. **Variable Scope**: `actualCommand` and `effectiveWorkingDir` were declared inside try block but used in catch block

### Impact
- Commands executed in `/workspace` instead of the project directory (e.g., `/workspace/projects/myapp`)
- Files created by commands appeared in wrong location
- Agent reported success but files weren't where expected
- Affected all command-based operations: `npm install`, `npx create-react-app`, file creation via shell commands, etc.

## The Fix

### Changes Made

1. **Moved variable declarations outside try block**:
```typescript
// Before (WRONG):
try {
  let actualCommand = command;
  let effectiveWorkingDir = workingDir;
  // ...
} catch (error) {
  // actualCommand not accessible here!
}

// After (CORRECT):
let actualCommand = command;
let effectiveWorkingDir = workingDir;
try {
  // ...
} catch (error) {
  // Now accessible!
}
```

2. **Fixed fallback execution to use correct directory**:
```typescript
// Before (WRONG):
const { stdout, stderr } = await this.execAsync(command, {
  cwd: this.workspaceRoot,  // ❌ Always uses /workspace
  // ...
});

// After (CORRECT):
const { stdout, stderr } = await this.execAsync(actualCommand, {
  cwd: effectiveWorkingDir,  // ✅ Uses project directory
  // ...
});
```

## Verification

### New Integration Test Suite
Created `backend/src/mcp/__tests__/mcp-file-operations.integration.spec.ts` with 12 tests that verify:

1. **File Operations** (✅ All passing):
   - `write_file` creates actual files in project directory
   - `create_directory` creates actual directories
   - `read_file` reads from correct location
   - `list_files` lists correct directory
   - `delete_file` deletes from correct location

2. **Command Execution** (✅ Now fixed):
   - Commands execute in project directory
   - `pwd` returns correct directory
   - Files created via commands appear in project directory

3. **Complete Workflow** (✅ Verified):
   - Simulates agent creating React app structure
   - Verifies all files and directories actually exist
   - Confirms file contents are correct

### Test Results

**Before Fix**:
```
Tests:       2 failed, 10 passed, 12 total
- ❌ Commands executed in wrong directory
- ❌ Files created via commands not found
```

**After Fix**:
```
Tests:       12 passed, 12 total
- ✅ All file operations work correctly
- ✅ Commands execute in correct directory
- ✅ Complete project creation workflow verified
```

**All Unit Tests**:
```
Test Suites: 22 passed, 22 total
Tests:       344 passed, 9 skipped, 353 total
```

## Files Modified

1. `backend/src/mcp/mcp.service.ts`
   - Fixed `executeCommand()` method
   - Moved variable declarations outside try block
   - Fixed fallback execution to use correct working directory

2. `backend/src/mcp/__tests__/mcp-file-operations.integration.spec.ts` (NEW)
   - Comprehensive integration tests for file operations
   - Verifies actual file system changes
   - Tests complete agent workflow

## Impact on Production

### Before Fix
- ❌ Agent creates files in `/workspace` instead of project directory
- ❌ User sees "success" message but files missing
- ❌ `npm install` runs in wrong directory
- ❌ `npx create-react-app` creates app in wrong location

### After Fix
- ✅ All operations execute in correct project directory
- ✅ Files appear where expected
- ✅ Commands work as intended
- ✅ Agent behavior matches user expectations

## Related Issues

This fix resolves:
- Commands not executing in project directory
- Files created in wrong location
- Agent reporting success but no visible changes
- Inconsistent behavior between MCP server and fallback execution

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**: Run `npm test -- mcp` to verify all MCP functionality
2. **Integration Tests**: Run `npm test -- mcp-file-operations.integration.spec.ts`
3. **Manual Testing**: 
   - Create a new project
   - Ask agent to create files
   - Verify files appear in project directory
   - Run commands like `npm install`
   - Verify operations execute in correct location

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues:
1. Always declare variables used in catch blocks outside try blocks
2. Test fallback paths (when external services unavailable)
3. Add integration tests that verify actual file system changes
4. Log working directory in all file/command operations
5. Verify commands execute in expected location

## Conclusion

This was a critical bug that caused agent operations to fail silently. The fix ensures all file and command operations execute in the correct project directory, making the agent behavior consistent and predictable.

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and Verified
**Tests**: ✅ All passing (12/12 integration, 344/344 unit)
**Ready**: ✅ For production deployment
