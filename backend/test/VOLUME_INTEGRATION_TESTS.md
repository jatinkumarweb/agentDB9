## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

1. **Docker Access**
   - Tests require access to Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`)
   - Docker daemon must be running
   - User must have Docker permissions

2. **Test Database**
   - Test database must be created: `coding_agent_test`
   - See E2E_TEST_SETUP.md for database setup

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - `.env.test` must be properly configured
   - Docker socket path must be accessible

### Execute Tests

```bash
cd backend

# Run volume integration tests
npm run test:e2e:volume

# Run VSCode container tests
npm run test:e2e:vscode

# Run all integration tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### Test Execution Notes

- Tests run sequentially (maxWorkers: 1) to avoid Docker conflicts
- Each test suite has 30-second timeout for Docker operations
- Tests gracefully skip if endpoints are not implemented
- Cleanup is performed in afterAll hooks

## Test Architecture

### Docker Integration

Tests use the `dockerode` library to interact with Docker:

```typescript
import Docker from 'dockerode';

const docker = new Docker({ socketPath: '/var/run/docker.sock' });
```

### Volume Operations

**Creating a Volume:**
```typescript
await docker.createVolume({
  Name: volumeName,
  Labels: {
    'agentdb9.project.id': projectId,
    'agentdb9.managed': 'true',
  },
});
```

**Writing to Volume:**
```bash
docker run --rm -v ${volumeName}:/workspace alpine sh -c "echo 'content' > /workspace/file.txt"
```

**Reading from Volume:**
```bash
docker run --rm -v ${volumeName}:/workspace alpine cat /workspace/file.txt
```

### Container Operations

**Starting a Container:**
```typescript
const container = await docker.createContainer({
  Image: 'vscode-image',
  HostConfig: {
    Binds: [`${volumeName}:/workspace`],
  },
});
await container.start();
```

**Executing Commands:**
```bash
docker exec ${containerId} cat /workspace/file.txt
```

## API Endpoints Tested

### Volume Management

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/projects/:id/volume` | POST | Create volume for project |
| `/api/projects/:id/volume` | DELETE | Delete project volume |
| `/api/projects/:id` | GET | Get project with volume info |

### Workspace Management

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/workspaces` | POST | Create workspace |
| `/api/workspaces/:id/start` | POST | Start workspace container |
| `/api/workspaces/:id/stop` | POST | Stop workspace container |
| `/api/workspaces/:id/restart` | POST | Restart workspace container |
| `/api/workspaces/:id/status` | GET | Get container status |
| `/api/workspaces/:id/switch-project` | POST | Switch to different project |

### Project Management

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/projects` | POST | Create project |
| `/api/projects/:id` | GET | Get project details |
| `/api/projects/:id` | DELETE | Delete project |

## Expected Behavior

### Volume Lifecycle

1. **Creation**
   - Volume is created when project is created or on-demand
   - Volume name follows pattern: `agentdb9-project-{projectId}`
   - Labels are added for identification and management

2. **Usage**
   - Volume is mounted at `/workspace` in containers
   - Files are readable and writable
   - Permissions are preserved

3. **Persistence**
   - Data survives container restarts
   - Data survives container recreation
   - Data is only deleted when project is deleted

4. **Cleanup**
   - Volume is deleted when project is deleted
   - Cleanup may be asynchronous
   - Orphaned volumes are prevented

### Container Lifecycle

1. **Creation**
   - Container is created when workspace is started
   - Project volume is automatically mounted
   - Container has network access

2. **Running**
   - Container can execute commands
   - Files in volume are accessible
   - Resource usage is monitored

3. **Stopping**
   - Container can be gracefully stopped
   - Volume data is preserved
   - Container can be restarted

4. **Cleanup**
   - Container is removed when workspace is deleted
   - Volume is preserved for project reuse
   - Resources are properly released

## Graceful Degradation

Tests are designed to handle incomplete implementations:

```typescript
if (response.status === 404) {
  console.log('Endpoint not implemented - skipping test');
  return;
}
```

This allows tests to:
- Run against partial implementations
- Provide feedback on what's implemented
- Skip tests for missing features
- Avoid false failures

## Test Data Management

### Volume Naming

```typescript
const volumeName = `agentdb9-project-${projectId}`;
```

### Volume Labels

```typescript
Labels: {
  'agentdb9.project.id': projectId,
  'agentdb9.managed': 'true',
}
```

### Cleanup Strategy

```typescript
afterAll(async () => {
  // 1. Stop and remove containers
  if (containerId) {
    const container = docker.getContainer(containerId);
    await container.stop();
    await container.remove();
  }
  
  // 2. Remove volumes
  if (volumeName) {
    const volume = docker.getVolume(volumeName);
    await volume.remove({ force: true });
  }
  
  // 3. Delete API resources
  await request(app.getHttpServer())
    .delete(`/api/projects/${projectId}`)
    .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${authToken}`);
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Permission Denied on Docker Socket

**Cause:** User doesn't have access to `/var/run/docker.sock`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Add user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Or run tests with sudo (not recommended)
sudo npm run test:e2e:volume
```

### Issue: Volume Already Exists

**Cause:** Previous test run didn't clean up properly

**Solution:**
```bash
# List volumes
docker volume ls | grep agentdb9

# Remove specific volume
docker volume rm agentdb9-project-{id}

# Remove all test volumes
docker volume ls | grep agentdb9 | awk '{print $2}' | xargs docker volume rm
```

### Issue: Container Won't Start

**Cause:** Port conflict or resource constraints

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check running containers
docker ps

# Check container logs
docker logs {containerId}

# Check available resources
docker system df
```

### Issue: Tests Timeout

**Cause:** Docker operations taking too long

**Solution:**
- Increase test timeout in jest config
- Check Docker daemon performance
- Verify network connectivity
- Check disk space

### Issue: Volume Mount Not Working

**Cause:** SELinux or AppArmor restrictions

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check SELinux status
getenforce

# Temporarily disable (not recommended for production)
sudo setenforce 0

# Or add :z flag to volume mount
docker run -v ${volumeName}:/workspace:z alpine ls /workspace
```

## Performance Considerations

### Test Execution Time

- Volume creation: ~1-2 seconds
- Container start: ~3-5 seconds
- File operations: <1 second
- Container stop: ~2-3 seconds
- Cleanup: ~2-3 seconds

**Total per test suite:** ~30-60 seconds

### Resource Usage

- **Disk Space:** ~100MB per volume
- **Memory:** ~256MB per container
- **CPU:** Minimal during idle

### Optimization Tips

1. **Reuse Volumes**
   - Don't recreate volumes for each test
   - Use beforeAll/afterAll for setup/cleanup

2. **Parallel Execution**
   - Use unique volume names
   - Avoid port conflicts
   - Set maxWorkers appropriately

3. **Cleanup**
   - Always clean up in afterAll
   - Use force flag for removal
   - Handle errors gracefully

## Security Considerations

### Docker Socket Access

- Tests require Docker socket access
- This grants significant system privileges
- Only run tests in trusted environments
- Never expose Docker socket to untrusted code

### Volume Permissions

- Volumes may contain sensitive data
- Set appropriate file permissions
- Use volume encryption if needed
- Clean up volumes after tests

### Container Isolation

- Containers should run with limited privileges
- Use read-only mounts where possible
- Restrict network access if not needed
- Set resource limits

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Test Scenarios

1. **Volume Snapshots**
   - Test volume backup and restore
   - Verify snapshot integrity
   - Test point-in-time recovery

2. **Volume Sharing**
   - Test multiple containers accessing same volume
   - Verify concurrent access handling
   - Test file locking

3. **Volume Migration**
   - Test moving volumes between hosts
   - Verify data integrity after migration
   - Test volume replication

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure I/O throughput
   - Test with large files
   - Benchmark concurrent operations

5. **Security Testing**
   - Test volume encryption
   - Verify access controls
   - Test isolation between projects

### Integration with CI/CD

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Run Volume Integration Tests
  run: |
    cd backend
    npm run test:e2e:volume
  env:
    DOCKER_HOST: unix:///var/run/docker.sock
```
