```

## 🛠️ Debugging Capabilities

### **Detailed Error Reporting**
Each test provides specific error information:
```json
{
  "test": "Model Generation Test",
  "status": "failed",
  "error": "HTTP 500: Model not available",
  "duration": 2341,
  "recommendations": [
    "Check if codellama:7b is installed",
    "Verify Ollama service is running",
    "Pull missing models with: npm run setup:ollama"
  ]
}
```

  "status": "ok",
  "service": "AgentDB9 Backend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "environment": "development",
  "providers": {
    "ollama": "http://ollama:11434",
    "openai": true,
    "anthropic": false
  }
}

npm run health

# Expected output if healthy:
# ✅ Frontend: OK (234ms)
# ✅ Backend: OK (123ms)  
# ✅ LLM Service: OK (156ms)
```
