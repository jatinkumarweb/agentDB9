# Backend Restart Required

## Issue Identified

Your logs show the **OLD code is still running**:

```
Original URL: /proxy/3000/static/js/bundle.js
Extracted path: static/js/bundle.js          ← OLD CODE (stripping prefix)
Trying: http://vscode:3000/static/js/bundle.js
```

This is why you're getting HTML instead of JavaScript - the dev server receives `/static/js/bundle.js` without the `/proxy/3000/` prefix, so it returns a 404 HTML page.

## What Should Happen (New Code)

```
Original URL: /proxy/3000/static/js/bundle.js
Full request path: /proxy/3000/static/js/bundle.js  ← NEW CODE (keeps full path)
Trying: http://vscode:3000/proxy/3000/static/js/bundle.js
```

The dev server receives the full path including `/proxy/3000/` and serves the file correctly.

## Solution: Restart Backend

### Option 1: Docker Compose Restart (Recommended)

```bash
# From your local machine (not in Gitpod dev container)
docker compose restart backend

# Wait for backend to be ready (30 seconds)
sleep 30

# Verify
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Option 2: Use Restart Script

```bash
./restart-backend.sh
```

### Option 3: Full Rebuild (if restart doesn't work)

```bash
docker compose up -d --build backend
```

## Verification

After restarting, check the logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f backend
```

When you access `http://localhost:8000/proxy/3000/static/js/bundle.js`, you should see:

```
=== PROXY REQUEST START ===
Original URL: /proxy/3000/static/js/bundle.js
Full request path: /proxy/3000/static/js/bundle.js    ← NEW!
Query string: none
Port 3000 mapped to service: vscode
Trying: http://vscode:3000/proxy/3000/static/js/bundle.js  ← NEW!
✅ Success with vscode:3000
Response status: 200
Response content-type: application/javascript           ← NEW!
```

## Why Hot Reload Didn't Work

The backend is running in a Docker container with volume mounts. Hot reload (via `npm run start:dev`) should work, but sometimes:

1. **File system events don't propagate** from host to container
2. **NestJS watch mode misses changes** in certain conditions
3. **Volume mount caching** delays file updates

A manual restart ensures the new code is loaded.

## After Restart

1. ✅ Backend loads new code
2. ✅ Proxy forwards full path: `/proxy/3000/static/js/bundle.js`
3. ✅ Dev server receives full path
4. ✅ Dev server (with `PUBLIC_URL=/proxy/3000`) recognizes prefix
5. ✅ Dev server serves JavaScript file
6. ✅ Correct Content-Type: `application/javascript`
7. ✅ Browser executes bundle.js successfully

## Quick Test After Restart

```bash
# Test bundle.js
curl -I http://localhost:8000/proxy/3000/static/js/bundle.js

# Should show:
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=UTF-8
```

## Summary

**Current State:** Old code running (strips prefix) → 404 → HTML → MIME error  
**After Restart:** New code running (keeps prefix) → 200 → JavaScript → Success ✅

**Action Required:** Restart backend container to load new proxy code.
