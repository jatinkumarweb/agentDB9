# VS Code Proxy Fix Status

## Current Status: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### What Was Done

1. **VS Code Proxy Fix Implemented** (Commits: 5aac846, 2573f08)
   
   **Frontend Changes** (`frontend/src/components/VSCodeContainer.tsx`):
   ```typescript
   // Load VS Code through backend proxy instead of direct connection
   const backendUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL || 'http://localhost:8000';
   const baseUrl = `${backendUrl}/proxy/8080`;
   ```
   
   **VS Code Configuration** (`vscode/init-workspace.sh`):
   - Removed absolute `proxyUrl` configuration from port settings
   - VS Code now uses relative URLs (e.g., `/proxy/5173/`)
   - Relative URLs resolve to same origin as iframe
   
   **Docker Configuration** (`docker-compose.yml`):
   - Removed `PROXY_BASE_URL` environment variable (no longer needed)
   - Kept `VSCODE_PROXY=true` flag

2. **Test Infrastructure Created** (Commit: b506d22)
   - `tests/vscode-proxy.test.md` - 15 comprehensive test cases
   - `tests/vscode-proxy-test.sh` - Automated test script
   - `scripts/rollback-vscode-proxy.sh` - Safe rollback procedure
   - `docs/vscode-proxy-fix.md` - Complete documentation

### Environment Discovery

**Current Environment:** Gitpod Dev Container
- **Docker Available:** ❌ No
- **Services Running:** None (dev container only has Node.js)
- **Architecture:** Dev container without Docker-in-Docker

**Target Environment:** Docker Compose
- **Services:** backend, frontend, vscode, llm-service, mcp-server, ollama
- **Proxy:** Backend proxies VS Code (port 8080) and dev servers
- **Testing:** Requires Docker Compose to run services

### Testing Status

**Automated Tests:** ⚠️ Cannot run in current environment
- Requires: `docker-compose up -d` to start services
- Script: `./tests/vscode-proxy-test.sh`
- Environment: Docker Compose with all services running

**Manual Tests:** ⚠️ Cannot run in current environment
- Requires: Running backend, vscode, and frontend services
- Test cases: Documented in `tests/vscode-proxy.test.md`

### Next Steps

The VS Code proxy fix is **code complete** and **ready for testing** in a Docker Compose environment:

1. **In Docker Compose Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Start services
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Wait for services to be healthy
   docker-compose ps
   
   # Run automated tests
   ./tests/vscode-proxy-test.sh
   
   # Run manual tests
   # Follow tests/vscode-proxy.test.md
   ```

2. **If Tests Pass:**
   - Fix is verified ✅
   - Ready for production

3. **If Tests Fail:**
   - Use rollback script: `./scripts/rollback-vscode-proxy.sh`
   - Review logs and fix issues
   - Re-test

### How The Fix Works

**Problem:**
- Frontend loaded VS Code from `http://localhost:8080` (direct)
- VS Code generated preview URLs to `http://localhost:8000/proxy/5173/` (backend)
- Different origins → Browser blocks cross-origin iframe navigation

**Solution:**
- Frontend loads VS Code from `http://localhost:8000/proxy/8080/` (through backend)
- VS Code generates relative URLs `/proxy/5173/`
- Browser resolves to `http://localhost:8000/proxy/5173/` (same origin)
- ✅ Same origin = No CORS issues

**Flow:**
1. User opens `/workspace` page
2. Frontend loads VS Code iframe: `http://localhost:8000/proxy/8080/`
3. Backend proxies request to `vscode:8080`
4. User starts Vite dev server on port 5173
5. VS Code generates preview URL: `/proxy/5173/` (relative)
6. Browser resolves to: `http://localhost:8000/proxy/5173/` (same origin)
7. Backend proxies to `vscode:5173`
8. ✅ Preview loads successfully

### Files Changed

**Implementation (Commits: 5aac846, 2573f08):**
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/VSCodeContainer.tsx` - Load VS Code through backend proxy
- ✅ `vscode/init-workspace.sh` - Removed absolute proxyUrl, use relative URLs
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` - Removed PROXY_BASE_URL environment variable

**Testing & Documentation (Commit: b506d22):**
- ✅ `tests/vscode-proxy.test.md` - 15 comprehensive test cases
- ✅ `tests/vscode-proxy-test.sh` - Automated test script
- ✅ `scripts/rollback-vscode-proxy.sh` - Safe rollback procedure
- ✅ `docs/vscode-proxy-fix.md` - Complete documentation

### Rollback

If needed, rollback is safe and documented:
```bash
./scripts/rollback-vscode-proxy.sh
```

This will:
1. Revert git commits
2. Rebuild services
3. Restart containers
4. Verify rollback

---

**Summary:** The VS Code proxy fix is complete and ready for testing. Testing requires a Docker Compose environment which is not available in this Gitpod dev container. The fix should be tested in the actual deployment environment where Docker Compose runs the services.
